for APPLICATIONS requiring aware objects, datetime and time objects have an optional time zone information attribute, tzinfo, that can be set to an instance of a subclass of the abstract tzinfo class.
these tzinfo objects capture information about the offset from UTC time, the time zone name, and whether Daylight Saving Time is in effect.
note that only one CONCRETE tzinfo class, the timezone class, is supplied by the datetime module.
the timezone class can represent simple timezones with fixed offset from UTC, such as UTC itself or North American EST and EDT timezones.
supporting timezones at DEEPER levels of detail is up to the application.
the rules for time adjustment across the world are more political than rational, change frequently, and there is no standard suitable for every application aside from UTC.
